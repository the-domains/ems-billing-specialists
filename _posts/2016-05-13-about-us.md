About Us

EMS Billing Specialists was born from a need for a customer-centered billing company that specializes in providing the best customer service available. We do this by providing each of our customers with a dedicated billing specialist who becomes an expert on that customer's needs and is readily available to answer questions and provide assistance. Our billing specialists are thoroughly educated on the most up-to-date Medicare billing practices and guidelines and are able to accurately bill more claims with less rejections and denials, increasing our customers' cash flow and revenue per claim and decreasing their accounts receivable timelines.

We believe in providing the most comprehensive claims reviews available as well as internal audits and physician consultation when necessary at no extra charge to our customers. For more information on the services we offer, please visit the Our Services page.
